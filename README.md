hi!
this is Bayan, and this is the Recipe App from challenge 2 (Hello world! ðŸŒŽ) from Saudi Apple Developer Academy!
not all features work yet, but soon!!

in this app you should be able to add your recipes with your ingredients by choosing measurement type and quantity
as well as adding photo, title and description
you should be able to view the recipes as well as edit or delete them afterward!

happy coding! ðŸ’»
